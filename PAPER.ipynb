    "Physics has often advanced by seeking **minimal principles** that compress vast phenomena into a few words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Einstein’s postulates of relativity distilled anomalies into a symmetry of space and time.  \n",
    "Quantum mechanics arose from the recognition that energy and action are quantized.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we propose an even smaller seed: a single axiom about the **geometry of coherence**.  \n",
    "We call it the **Signed Polar Decomposition Axiom (SPDA)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It states that coherence — the persistence of physical systems across transformation — can be universally expressed through a **polar decomposition with signed phase orientation**.  \n",
    "The sign encodes direction of propagation ($\\pm$), while the phase encodes resonance memory.  \n",
    "Geometrically, this corresponds to a **helical trajectory** in the complex plane: its orientation is preserved, its projection yields the familiar wave.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Why introduce such an axiom?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two motivations drive this work:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity and reproducibility.**  \n",
    "   Contemporary theory is layered with Lagrangians and postulates that obscure first principles.  \n",
    "   SPDA reduces the structure to one geometric primitive: the signed phase orientation of a polar form.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Minimal bridge to field theory.**  \n",
    "   By packaging oriented phase states into a complex field, one directly recovers the standard wave modes  \n",
    "   $\\psi \\sim e^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}-\\omega t)}$.  \n",
    "   In natural units ($c=\\hbar=1$), the frequency–wavevector pair $(\\omega,\\mathbf{k})$ maps transparently to energy–momentum $(E,\\mathbf{p})$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper has four goals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **State the axiom cleanly** and release it to the public domain.  \n",
    "- **Provide geometric interpretation**, clarifying how waves emerge as projections of signed helices in phase space.  \n",
    "- **Demonstrate its power** by deriving Klein–Gordon, Dirac, and gauge coupling directly from the axiom.  \n",
    "- **Reflect on implications**, showing how quantum phenomena may be reframed as manifestations of preserved resonance memory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The SPDA is not an alternative model of physics, but a **reduction of physics to its simplest statement**.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Unlike standard treatments, which begin by postulating a Lagrangian, SPDA shows that the canonical structures of relativistic quantum theory emerge necessarily from phase-orientation coherence itself.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Subsequent work will extend this framework, but here we keep focus on the core axiom and its immediate consequences.\n"
